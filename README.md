# Klasio — simple static demo

This repository contains a small static demo of a modern educational UI called Klasio.

Files added/updated:
- `index.html` — main landing page with responsive nav, hero, features and footer
- `css/style.css` — styles and animations
- `js/main.js` — small interactions: mobile nav toggle, reveal animations, smooth scroll
- `auth.html` — demo login/register page

To preview locally, open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder (recommended):

```bash
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

If you want, I can add icons, real images, or wire up a backend for auth and tasks.
